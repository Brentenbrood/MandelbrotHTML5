# MandelbrotHTML5
A Mandelbrot fractal made in Javascript/HTML5

You can zoom in by dragging your mouse and selecting a rectangle. It is not infinite zoom, because at some point
Javascript decides there needs to be a limit and show pixels. Haven't fixed that yet. If someone finds out how to fix that, 
send me a pull request :)/
